CCS to CHAdeMO converter information and code  

This repository serves as a centre for gathering together both the code (src directory) and  
all the relevant information (Wiki) necessary to build a CCS2 to CHAdeMO converter interfacing    
to a Nissan Leaf model 2 (Tekna+ with a 62kWh battery).  

It draws almost entirely on information from the https://openinverter.org/forum/index.php forum,  
and in particular the topic https://openinverter.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=85930&hilit=osexpert#p85930   

The work of Uwe Hennig (https://github.com/uhi22), Johannes Huber (https://github.com/johu), and many  
more is gratefully acknowledged.
